Retailer Game Simulation: Markdown Optimization Strategy

Game URL: https://www.randhawa.us/games/retailer/nyu.html

Objective
You are tasked with maximizing total revenue by optimally pricing a fashion apparel item over a 15-week selling season. You begin with an inventory of 2,000 units. There are no costs or salvage value—any unsold items at the end of the 15 weeks are discarded with no residual value.

Key Rules
- The list price is $60, and Week 1 must always be sold at this price.
- From Week 2 onward, you can apply one of the following markdown actions:
  - Maintain (no change in price)
  - 10% markdown → $54
  - 20% markdown → $48
  - 40% markdown → $36 (final markdown – ends decision-making; all future sales are at this price)
- Once a markdown is applied, prices cannot be increased.
- Markdowns are irreversible and sequential:
  - After a 10% markdown, you cannot go back to maintaining the original price.
  - After a 20% markdown, you cannot choose 10% or 0%.
  - A 40% markdown ends further pricing decisions, but weekly simulations continue through Week 15.

Demand Model
- Demand is stochastic and varies each week, even at the same price.
- Each run simulates a different product with its own demand curve, defined by a unique mean and standard deviation at each price point.
- While absolute demand levels vary, the relative demand lift from markdowns is consistent across products.
  - Example: If reducing the price from $60 to $54 increases demand by 25% in one scenario, it is likely to have a similar proportional effect in others.

Sales Rule
- Actual weekly sales = min{demand, remaining inventory}

Game Interface
Each week, you will see the following table:

| Week | Price | Sales | Remaining Inventory |
|------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| ...  | ...   | ...   | ...                 |

You also have access to the following action buttons:
- Restart Game (start new simulation)
- Maintain Price (no markdown)
- 10% (apply 10% markdown)
- 20% (apply 20% markdown)
- 40% (apply 40% markdown and end decisions)

Output and Data Collection
Each simulation round generates two outputs:

CSV 1: Weekly Detail ("Week Detail")
Columns:
- Simulation Number
- comboID
- Week
- Price
- Sales
- Remaining Inventory

CSV 2: Simulation Outcome ("Outcome")
Columns:
- Simulation Number
- comboID
- Your Revenue
- Perfect Foresight Strategy
- Difference (%)

Example Output (Displayed In-Game):

| Week | Price | Sales | Remaining Inventory |
|------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 1    | 60    | 91    | 1909                |
| 2    | 60    | 109   | 1800                |
| 3    | 54    | 87    | 1713                |
| 4    | 48    | 175   | 1538                |
| …    | …     | …     | …                   |
| 10   | 36    | 136   | 0                   |
| …    | 36    | 0     | 0                   |

Summary Metrics (End of Simulation):
- Your revenue: $84,726
- Perfect foresight revenue: $98,946
- Difference: 14.4%

Summary
This game challenges you to design a dynamic markdown strategy that adapts to uncertain and evolving demand patterns. Your goal is to develop an approach that consistently maximizes revenue while balancing markdown depth, timing, and remaining inventory.
