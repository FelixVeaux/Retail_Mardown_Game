To create a system that plays the Retailer Game hosted at the provided URL: https://www.randhawa.us/games/retailer/nyu.html

There are 15 weeks in the selling season: 
14 weeks for decisions, since the $60 price is set for the first week. 
The initial stock is 2000 units. 
The objective is to maximize the total revenue from the available stock during the 15 weeks

The stock left-over at the end of the 15 weeks is lost. There is no salvage value. 
There are no costs to worry about since the production costs for the items are already sunk

Different runs: 
Each time you play the game, it is as if you are running it for a different item, with each item having its own demand curve. 
The demand curve has an associated mean and standard deviation for each price

Demand estimation hint: Demand lift with respect to price is homogenous across items. E.g., if a drop in price from $60 to $54 causes a demand lift of 25% on a given item, it is likely to cause a similar lift on other items. 
The absolute demand varies from item to item but the relative demand lift from the same price drop is similar across items. 


Optimal markdown strategy to maximise revenue for 2000 t-shirts in 15 Week

Demand is random from week to week (even at the same price).


14 decisions (1 per week)

Action :
1.	Maintain
2.	10%
3.	20%
4.	40% (no further actions can be taken after this but week simulations keep going untill week 15)

Week 1 is = Maintain (60$)

If you go to option 2 meaning 10% you cant go bac to option 1. Same if you do 3 you cant do 2 & 1. And if you do 4 it ends the simulation and sells all remaining products at 40% markdown.

Strategy that adapts to how the game adapts. The demand changes. It is not the same every time.


Sales = Min{Demand, Inventory}

You are in charge of selling 2,000 items of a brand new fashion apparel. Your goal is to select the optimal pricing strategy to maximize revenues. The list price of the item is $60, and it must be sold at the list price for at least one week. After this, the item may be discounted to $54 (a 10% discount), to $48 (a 20% discount), or to $36 (a 40% discount). Once lowered, the price may not be increased.
The sales season is 15 weeks long. Production lead times are long enough that additional items cannot be procured during the sales season. All items remaining at the end of the sales horizon will be discarded at $0 value


The game will show you for each week in table format: Week, Price, Sales, Remaining Inventory.
You will also have 5 buttons you can click : « restart game » (it starts the next game), « maintain price » (action A : stays at current price), « 10% » (Action B : 10% markdown), « 20% » (Action C : 20% markdown), « 40% » (Action C : 40% markdown)

I want the output of each simulation round to be saved to 2 CSV. 1 CSV with all simulation detail week by week and another CSV with the outcome details.
CSV 1 (« Week detail ») will have columns : Simulation Number, comboID, Week, Price, Sales, Remaining Inventory
CSV 2 (« Outcome ») will have columns : Simulation Number, comboID, Your revenue, Perfect foresight strategy, Difference (%)

This is how the output information you have to collect is:
<table id="result-table" cellspacing="0" title="Weekly performance">

<th>Week</th>
<th>Price</th>
<th>Sales</th>
<th>Remaining Inventory</th>
